     *      vertically touching the current Position
     * ---- Note also that a valid Position to add to your list will be one that, in conjunction with those
     *      Positions that precede it, form a legal PREFIX to a word in the Dictionary (this is important!)
     * ---- Use the "isPrefix" method in the Dictionary class to help you out here!!
     * ---- Positions that already exist in your list of stored positions will also be invalid.
     * ---- You'll be finished when you have checked EVERY possible list of Positions on the board, to see
     *      if they can be used to form a valid word in the dictionary.
     * ---- Food for thought: If there are N Positions on the grid, how many possible lists of positions
